Splitting Intensity
--------------------

Splitting intensity derives from the property that split energy on the transverse component should have similar form as the time derivative of the 
radial component.  The approach was first applied in a shear wave splitting context by Vinnik et al. (1989) and the `splitting intensity` was introduced by Chevrot (2000).  Since then the method has been developed further, e.g., Sieminski et al. (2008), Monteiller and Chevrot (2010).

However, the method only works if the size of splitting is sufficiently smaller than the wavelength of the shear energy pulse, I have found by testing that the method breaks down if the delay time gets beyond about a quarter of the wavelength.

A different approach to the grid search methods so far mentioned are the so-called multi-channel methods.  The method essentially characterises splitting by the amount of energy on the transverse component.  An estimate of the splitting parameters is made by recognising systematic variations in the transverse energy as a function of polarisation.  

It is defined as the projection of the time derivative of the radial component

This method has some potential advantages in the tomographic problem as the splitting intensity commutes at the .
